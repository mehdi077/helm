# Helm - AI-Powered Infinite Document

Helm is a sophisticated writing application that integrates advanced AI text completion capabilities into a modern, minimalist editor interface. Built with Next.js and TipTap, this application transforms the writing process by providing intelligent, context-aware text suggestions that users can selectively accept or modify.
